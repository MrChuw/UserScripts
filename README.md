# UserScripts Collection

This is a collection of userscript that I have created myself or modified to fit my user case better.

## Better Twitch Player
This script is made to simulate [Alternate Player for Twitch.tv](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/alternate-player-for-twit/bhplkbgoehhhddaoolmakpocnenplmhf) ([Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/twitch_5/))  
By replacing the scroll and middle click behavior, to increase/decrease or mute volume.  
Automatically entering Theater Mode and Changing resolutions to source.

## Location Guard (No UI)
Its just a modified version of [Location Guard Ng](https://github.com/SukkaW/location-guard-ng), without the UI/Site configs.

---

## Auto VTT Downloader
Used to automatically download `.vtt` files.  
I made it to download subtitles for videos from when I was in college.
